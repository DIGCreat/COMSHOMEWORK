Phrasal verbs, or as they're sometimes known, multi-word verbs, are very common in English. They're formed of a main verb and a preposition, or sometimes a main verb and two prepositions. To help you learn them, Dan offered these three points to consider:

Transitive = takes an object
I (subject) broke up with him (object).

Intransitive = doesn't take an object
My car (subject) broke down (no object).

Some verbs can be both transitive and intransitive.
